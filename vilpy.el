When `vilpy-mode' is on, most unprefixed keys,
i.e. [a-zA-Z+-./<>], conditionally call commands instead of
self-inserting. The condition (called special further on) is one
of:

- the point is before \"(\"
- the point is after \")\"
- the region is active

For instance, when special, \"j\" moves down one sexp, otherwise
it inserts itself.

When special, [0-9] call `digit-argument'.

When `vilpy-mode' is on, \"[\" and \"]\" move forward and
backward through lists, which is useful to move into special.
